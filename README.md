# destination inference model
 

matlab code for individual metro trip destination inference based on smart card data

Each user contains a set of tuples (origin, time, destination) {(w^o, w^t, w^d)}. 
The objective is to get the destination probability of a new trip p_u(w^di|w^oi,w^ti,w^o{all except i},w^t{all except i},w^d{all except i}).
